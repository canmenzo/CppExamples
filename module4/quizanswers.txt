loop guarantees at least 1 iteration = do

pre increment ++a
pre decrement --a
post increment a++
post decrement a--

count++;
--count;

int counter = 10;
int counter2 = ++counter;
int counter3 = counter2--;
11,10,11

i < 20; i*=2
answer = 5

i<20; i--
anwer = infinite

statment results in a premature exit from loop = break

statement skips the remaining code in loop and jumps back to start = continue

initials expression of a FOR loop is initializing the index variable

i < 5; i++ for 5 iterations

remainder question
	answer is not while (m/units ==0)
	also not while (m%units)
	THE ANSWER IS WHILE (!(M%UNITS))

	the ! operator will result in an evaluation of true as long as (m % units) is 0, or false. If (m % units) is non-zero, it is effeectively true and the while loop condition will fail...mo

header file included in c++ is fstream for file streams
to create a file and open it for writing = ofstream
used to open a file for reading = ifstream

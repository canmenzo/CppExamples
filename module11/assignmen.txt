Download the "invertebrates.h" class specification file included in this module and use it to implement the Invertebrate class and Spider class specified in that file. Implement these classes in a single file named "invertebrates.cpp", and use the following main function in your solution:

int main()
{
    Spider *sp = new Spider("Brown Recluse");
    sp->print();

    Spider sp2("Black Widow");
    sp2.print();

    Spider sp3 = *sp; // calls copy constructor
    sp3.print();

    sp2 = *sp; // calls = overload
    sp2.print();

    delete sp;

    return 0;
}

DO NOT redeclare the classes in your .cpp file, you should implement the classes based on the specification in the header (you should be using the scope resolution operator "::" a lot in your solution). Include the header as a preprocessor declaration in your .cpp file, but do not submit the header file content with or in your solution.

Expected output:

Spider: Brown Recluse, number of legs = 8, skeleton type = exoskeleton
Spider: Black Widow, number of legs = 8, skeleton type = exoskeleton
Spider: Brown Recluse, number of legs = 8, skeleton type = exoskeleton
Spider: Brown Recluse, number of legs = 8, skeleton type = exoskeleton
